We’re Ohana Sports Tech — a family business founded by close friends who believe that sports training should be simple, effective, and most of all, fun.

Our team comes from all over the map, but we’ve planted our roots in Seattle, Washington. We’re former software and hardware engineers from big tech companies, and we’ve brought that experience into a new chapter: building smart, easy-to-use sports solutions that help people train better and enjoy the process.

Our name, Ohana, means family in Hawaiian — and that’s exactly how we work. We’re a tight-knit team bonded not just by friendship and family, but by our shared love for sports, recreation, and frequent escapes to the Hawaiian islands. That connection to Hawaii inspires the spirit behind everything we build: low-stress, high-impact products that bring joy back into training.

We're passionate about designing tools that remove the complexity from sports practice — whether it’s through intuitive tech, reliable gear, or thoughtful design. We want athletes, coaches, and families to spend less time fiddling with equipment and more time playing, improving, and enjoying the game.

At our core, we believe in:

* **Simplicity** over stress
* **Connection** over competition
* **Joy** in the journey, not just the results

From a tennis court in Seattle to a beach in Kauai, we’re building a world where training feels like play — and performance comes naturally.

**Mahalo for being here.**
